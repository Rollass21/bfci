# Why?
Learning purposes.

Recently I found out about this excellent, magnificent and most of all easy to understand programming language called [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and figured that doing something like this could help me learn some new things.

Keep in mind this is just a little hobby project and is not intended to be used as profesional grade development tool.
Every kind of helpful feedback will be greatly appreciated.
